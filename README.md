# Monopoly-C#
My first C# game, made in 2018-2019 in College.
I made this game in a few months when I was 17/18 and it was my first experience with windows forms.
I changed some of the rules to make it easier for me to code and didn't have time to include hotels and double rolls.
I thought uploading this would help people get started on developing in C#, like me, and looking for similar systems to mine. 
When starting out I couldn't find that many examples of a monopoly c# game that I could understand. 
I also uploaded this so I can show friends later on...
